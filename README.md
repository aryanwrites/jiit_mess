# Mess Schedule Project  

## Overview  
This project involves using a `menu.JSON` file, which was converted from an image, to implement a mess schedule. The primary goal was to experiment with JSON data handling and learn through hands-on experience. It was my first time working with a JSON file, and I gained several valuable insights along the way.


## Learning Experience  
- Explored how to parse and utilize JSON data in a project.  
- Understood the structure of JSON files and how they can be used for dynamic content.  
- Gained practical experience in handling data formats, which will be helpful for future projects.  

## UI and Design  
The project was primarily intended for learning purposes, so I didn't focus much on the user interface. However, the functionality and logic were prioritized to ensure the schedule implementation works effectively.

## Future Improvements  
- Enhancing the UI to make the schedule visually appealing and user-friendly.  
- Adding interactive features such as filters or search functionality.  
- Optimizing the JSON data structure for better performance.  

## Acknowledgment  
This was a fun and insightful project that helped me understand the basics of working with JSON files. It laid the foundation for handling data-driven applications in the future.
